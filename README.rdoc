= ValidatableAssociations

ValidatableAssociations is an add-on to the {Validatable}[http://validatable.rubyforge.org]
gem by Jay Fields. It adds the most common association methods provided by Rails to your
validatable Class and allows to set up a decent validatable structure.

== Install

  $ script/plugin install git://github.com/rubiii/validatable_associations.git

== Associations

=== A very simple example

  class User
    include Validatable
    include ValidatableAssociations

    has_one :gorilla

    attr_accessor :username, :password

    validates_presence_of :username
    validates_length_of :password, :minimum => 6
  end

  class Gorilla
    include Validatable
    include ValidatableAssociations

    attr_accessor :name, :size

    validates_presence_of :name
    validates_numericality_of :size
  end

Now calling the valid? method provided by the Validatable library will also run the
validations for every associated validatable class.

=== Implemented association types:

The first version of this add-on only includes has_one associations.
I intend to only add more associations if I need them myself or if anyone convinces
me that he really needs support for another type of association.

== Mass-assignment

You can use mass-assignment to assign multiple values to your class at once.
This also includes each association.

  user = User.new :username => "apricot", :password => "secret",
    :gorilla => { :name => "Joe", :size => 4411 }

== Validation

Call the valid? method to validate your class and all associations.

  user.valid?
